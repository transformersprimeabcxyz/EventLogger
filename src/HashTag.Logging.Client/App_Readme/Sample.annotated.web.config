    HashTag.Logging.SourceLevels (optional. default: Information,ActivityTracing)
    
    Common separated list of severity of events to be passed to configured IEventStoreConnector (e.g. NLog, TraceSource)
    See: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.sourcelevels(v=vs.110).aspx
    
    Off               - no messages passed to event store
    Critical          - unhandled error (possibly).  Usually triggers request for immediate attention
    Error             - an unexpected error occured (logical or execution).  System might be able to recover.  
                        System support might be notified
    Warning           - 
    Information       - information sender deems to be important but no action is needed
    Verbose           - debug/state type events (not recommended for normal production use)
    ActivityTracing   - Start/Stop/Transfer events (often used in processing type apps or session.start/ended messages)
    All               - all events passed to event store  
        
    RECOMMENDATION:  Use this value to control how much logging is generated and leave 
    log store filter to accept all events from event builder.

  NLog Configuration
  
  CONVENTION:
  
    Place this section at the end of the .config file
  
  See: https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Tutorial
  
  NOTE:  Usually control logging verbosity using the HashTag.Logging.SourceLevels entry and leave
         NLog levels to Trace (e.g. all messages); unless there's a specific use-case to override
         the defaults.
         
         Using the appSetting approach allows the NLog section to be generally ignored!
    
  NOTE:  IEventLogger is compatible with NLog so any NLog configuration can be used.  Below
         are suggested defaults but may be changed as desired

NLOG LOG LEVELS
    
    Fatal    - very serious errors!
    Error    - error messages - most of the time these are Exceptions
    Warn     - warning messages, typically for non-critical issues, which can be recovered or which are temporary failures
    Info     - information messages, which are normally enabled in production environment
    Debug    - debugging information, less detailed than trace, typically not enabled in production environment.    
    Trace    - very detailed logs, which may include high-volume information such as protocol payloads. This log level is typically only enabled during development
    
LEVEL MAPING

    DEPLOYMENT Notes/Suggestions:  (Use appSetting::HashTag.Logging.SourceLevels to control logging unless app does not use IEventLogger Wrapper)

CONFIGURATION NOTES

  throwExceptions - throw an exception if a configuration error occurs. Helps detect deployment and transformation errors

  extensionAssembly (see: https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Extending%20NLog)
      Set to assembly containing custom NLog custom targets (Default: HashTag.Logging.Client)
     
  rules: (see: https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file#rules)
      (default: save all events with any severity to target; since they were filtered with IEventLogger)
  
    NOTE:  If you don't see expected output to log store, rules are the first place to verify
    NOTE:  You can define as many rules as are required
    
    writeTo - write to a comma separated list of targets when rule evaluates to True
    
  targets
    async=true (see: https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/AsyncWrapper-target)
        Ensures writing to targets occur on a non-UI/primary thread
        For more asynchronous control, use an asynchronous wrapper target. (see referenced site)
